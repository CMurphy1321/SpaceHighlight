# SpaceHighlight

Toggle highlighting of tab characters and trailing whitespace with ease. I recommend using something like the following:

map \<Leader>w :ToggleSpaceHi<CR>

map \<Leader>t :ToggleTabHi<CR>

Largely inspired by spacehi by Adam Lazur (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=443).
